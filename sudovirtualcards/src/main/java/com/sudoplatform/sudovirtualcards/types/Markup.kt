/**
 * The rates of markup applied to a [Transaction] when calculating the fees.
 *
 * @property percent [Int] Floating point percentage amount applied in calculating total markup multiplied by 1000.
 *  For example: 2990 for 2.99%. 1/1000th of a percent is the smallest granularity that can be represented.
 * @property flat [Int] Flat amount applied in calculating total markup in minor currency unit of billed currency in containing
 *  transaction detail e.g. 31 for $0.31.
 * @property minCharge [Int] The minimum charge that will be made to the funding source. For example, if a small charge of $0.10
 *  were made with a 2.99%+$0.31 fee formula then the resultant fee would be $0.31 cents resulting in an
 *  expected funding source charge of $0.41 cents. If [minCharge] is set and more than this amount then the
 *  [minCharge] will be charged instead.
